Hello,

Getting familiarized with Git

Yep!
See ya

Just learned common git commands:
>git init
>ls
>ls -a
> git status (initially found 1 untracked file/ moved it to staging areas in order to get tracked by git by using git add command)
> git add first.txt
> git status (checked status once again, the file can now be tracked for Changes made to it/ but nothing committed yet)
> git commit -m "my first commit" (git commit with message(-m "---")  ) 
> git log (log of all commits made)
